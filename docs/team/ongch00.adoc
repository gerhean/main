== PROJECT: My Internship Diary

---

== Overview

My Internship Diary is a desktop address book desktop internship tracking application written in Java, and has about
15 kLoC. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Revamp the find command
** This enhancement enables the general find where it works similarly to Ctrl-F on most programs. It will take in
the keywords you entered will list any internship application that has fields that matches any of the keywords provided.
** This enhancement also enables the specific find, where it the user can specify what which field they are
interested in searching in. The user can find in multiple fields as well. In this case, only the internship
applications that has the fields matching the specified fields will be listed.

** This enhancement posed a challenge as:
*** Quite a bit of planning involved, mainly to consider how I should perform the search, and how I can separate the
general and specific find. At the end the plan to use predicates was decided
*** Quite a bit of knowledge with how predicates work is required as I needed to know how I can combine the required
predicates cleanly so that it is readable and to ensure that it is correct.

* *Minor enhancement*: Add visual display of upcoming application deadlines and interviews and inactive applications
** This enhancement allows the user to determine which application has deadlines or interviews due in 7 days or if
there are ghosted application in a quick glance. Internship application with upcoming deadline will show green while
inactive application will show red.
** This enhancement, while minor, posed some challenges as well:
*** Setting it in CSS is not possible as I still wanted to keep the odd and even colors.
*** Setting it in code without first saving the CSS style would cause the style to not reset to the default CSS style.
