== PROJECT: Internship Diary

This portfolio provides an overview of my contributions to the software engineering project *Internship Diary*.

== Overview

*Internship Diary* is a desktop-based internship application tracking software.

The idea for this software came about when we realised that the nature of a computer science degree is internship-driven;
in the sense that having the best possible internship experience during candidature will greatly improve your chance of landing a good job as a fresh graduate.
Essentially, your first big internship will serve as a pivotal moment for your future career. Having said that, internship application is often a
tedious and messy process as companies having different hiring processes and requirements.

We set out to tackle this pain point -- by coming up with a solution to help computer science students manage and streamline their internship application journey.
We aim to make every student's internship hunt during their four years as a computer science undergraduate a pleasant one, and hopefully maximise their chances of landing the best possible internship.

Internship Diary offers a one-stop solution for users to organise and track their internship applications. It enables users to retrieve any information about
their internship applications easily so that they can keep themselves updated with the companies they have applied to.

This will motivate students to freely apply for many different companies and roles because they know that Internship Diary is always keeping their applications organized.
Consequently, this may improve their chance of landing an internship.

== Summary of Contributions

=== Enhancements

. Implemented the Archival System

* *What it does*: Allows users to move their internship applications from the main list to the archival list and vice-versa.
* *Justification*: This feature is particularly important as it helps users to keep their internship applications organized. Whenever there are
internship application(s) that are no longer relevant / of interest to the user, the user can archive those internship applications so that
it "de-clutters" their main list. This allows them to focus on the internship application(s) that are more important currently.
* *Highlights*: The archival feature seems trivial as it is usually a staple feature in many tracking applications.
However, it was challenging to decide on a design implementation for our use case such that the feature is sustainable and extensible.
Due to the chosen design, there was a need to implement a form of observer pattern to handle reactivity issues -- this became another important design consideration.
Furthermore, for the `archive` and `unarchive` commands, the concept of enabling multiple execution types (e.g. by index, indices, and status) was
not trivial to design and implement as well.


. Implemented the Statistics feature

* *What it does*: The statistics feature dynamically generates relevant metrics from the list of internship application(s) in the current view (e.g. archival).
* *Justification*: The hunt for internship can be seen as a journey of growth in terms of personal and professional development.
The statistics feature provides users with important information about their internship application journey in terms of numbers, which the user can interpret and generate insights.
* *Highlights*: Implementing the Statistics feature on its own was straightforward. The difficulty lies in how it can be implemented in an extensible manner.
For example, the addition of a new status would not require the refactoring of model. To solve the issue, a HashMap was used to hold the counter for each status.
This required careful design considerations.
